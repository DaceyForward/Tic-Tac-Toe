## Wireframe of the UI

High Fidelity

- Buttons are clickable
- Hover effects happen on buttons

Low Fidelity
- Drawing of the app
- Layout of the page
- Header location
- Button location
- Cluttered/crowded sections or empty sections?

## Pseudocode

Overall App Logic
- Page loads with empty tic-tac-toe board
- (Game is started or player chooses color with button?)
- Message displaying whose turn it is shows and switches after each click in a cell on gameboard
- Player hovers over cells (which turn slightly grey when hovered on) then clicks inside cell to complete turn
- Message displays next player's turn
- Next player hovers over cells (which turn slightly grey when hovered on) then clicks inside cell to complete turn
- When a player has clicked inside a cell, that cell is no longer available (not clickable and has no color-change on hover)
- Repeats and continues until all 9 cells are covered (tie) or someone gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- Message displays winner or tie game
- When the message displays, the "play again" button displays at the bottom
- When the play again button is clicked, the board is empty and steps repeat

## Identify the Application's State (Data)
The app needs to remember:
- The color the user has chosen
- Which cell the user has clicked
